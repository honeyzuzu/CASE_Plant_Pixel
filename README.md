<h1>KNN Plant Leaf Color Classifier</h1>
<p>This C++ program is designed to classify the color of a plant leaf using its HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) values. The classification is then used to determine the health status of the plant.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The health of a plant can often be inferred from the color of its leaves. This program employs the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the color of a plant leaf based on its HSV values. The KNN algorithm is a simple, yet effective, machine learning technique used for classification tasks.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> HSV values of plant leaves are collected from images captured using a camera or any imaging device capable of capturing HSV values.</li>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> The collected data is used to train the KNN classifier. During training, the program analyzes the HSV values and assigns labels to them based on known health statuses of the corresponding plant leaves (e.g., healthy, diseased, stressed).</li>
    <li><strong>Classification:</strong> When provided with HSV values of a new plant leaf, the KNN algorithm identifies the K nearest neighbors from the training dataset. It then determines the most common class among these neighbors and assigns the corresponding health status to the new leaf.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<p>This program requires the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or later)</li>
    <li>OpenCV library for image processing and HSV color space conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure that OpenCV is properly installed and configured on your system before compiling and running the program.</p>
